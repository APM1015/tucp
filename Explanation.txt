    Tucp was a lab that took me a fairly long time to finish. I created four functions to go along with my main method.
  My main method simply checks how many file or directory arguments are given. Then takes the last argument given
  and check wether or not that argument is a file or directory using my checkDir function. If it is a file and 
  not a directory then my copySourToDest function is called. If it is a directory and has more than two arguments 
  then a for loop is iterated calling each of the files leading up to the directory with my multSourToDir function.
  If it is a directory with two arguments then my multSourToDir function is called. 
    My copySourToDest function takes in the two arguments then puts the first one in a source pointer, opens it, 
 and reads it. Then second argument is put into a dest pointer, opened, and activated to write. Then I created a 
 char that goes through a while loop and gets each piece from the first file until there is nothing left. This while
 loop is putting the chars into the second dest file. Once this is completed then the two pointers are closed.
    My copySourToDir and copySourToDir functions are the same(I just got it working and do not want to mess with 
 it anymore). They are similiar to the copySourToDest function. However, they create a new file pointer. This 
 pointer is set equal in the directory. This allowed me to call the same while loop and put the chars from the first
 file into this directory file. The files are then closed.
